CV Automation & Personalization Tool

## Summary

Automatically transform intake notes, current CVs, and vacancy descriptions into a professional CV in a consistent house style. Saves time, ensures alignment with job requirements, and highlights candidate strengths.

## Background

Many recruiters and professionals struggle to manually adjust CVs to match every new vacancy. This project addresses that problem by:

* Streamlining CV updates to match vacancy-specific requirements.
* Standardizing layout, language, and formatting for readability.
* Highlighting relevant skills and experience automatically.
* Reducing errors and inconsistencies in manual CV editing.

Personal motivation: simplify recruitment and career processes, reduce time wasted on formatting and rewriting CVs, and provide candidates with a polished, targeted CV each time.

## How is it used?

The workflow for this solution:

1. **Input collection**
   * Intakeverslag (personal interview notes, personality assessment, certificates)
   * Huidig CV (existing resume document)
   * Vacancy description (role, requirements, keywords)

2. **Processing**
   * Analyze key skills, experiences, and achievements from CV and intakeverslag.
   * Match candidate experience with vacancy requirements.
   * Generate CV sections according to house style (intro, experience, skills, education, certifications, personality traits, etc.).

3. **Output**
   * Polished CV in house style (Markdown, PDF, or Word format).
   * Optional: visual summary (timeline, skill bars, or pie charts for time allocation).

**User environment:** Recruiters, HR professionals, or candidates. Works in situations where CV needs to be customized quickly for multiple vacancies.
